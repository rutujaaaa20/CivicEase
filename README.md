# City Report Management System

## 1. Application Description

The **City Report Management System** is a RESTful web service that allows citizens to report municipal issues, such as:
- Damaged roads
- Public littering
- Broken streetlights
- Other infrastructure problems

The application streamlines the process of handling, assigning, and resolving these issues by enabling city employees and technicians to collaborate through a structured workflow.

---

## 2. Features

- Citizens can report issues with descriptions, location, and priority.
- Reports progress through dynamic statuses: `NEW`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `RESOLVED`.
- Reports are assigned to departments and technicians.
- Technicians can update report statuses.
- RESTful API built with Spring Boot and Hibernate (JPA).
- API documentation via **SpringDoc OpenAPI / Swagger UI**.

---

## 3. Workflow

1. Citizen submits a report with description, location, and priority.
2. The report is saved with status `NEW`.
3. A municipal employee assigns the report to a `Department`.
4. A department head assigns the report to one or more `Technicians` ‚Üí status becomes `IN_PROGRESS`.
5. Technician resolves the issue and updates status to `RESOLVED`.
